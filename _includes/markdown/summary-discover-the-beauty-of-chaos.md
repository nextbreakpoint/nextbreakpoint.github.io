NextFractal is an application for exploring fractals, and other algorithmically generated images. Images are generated processing a script, and some other configurable parameters.

NextFractal provides tools for rendering fractals, creating *time-based* and *event-based animations*, organising images, and exporting images and animations. There is a video on the web site which shows the main feature of the application.

NextFractal is currently able to interpret two scripting languages: Mandelbrot and CFDG. Mandelbrot is a domain specific language for creating images of the Mandelbrot's set (and its variants, such as Julia and Fatou sets). CFDG which is a context-free grammar for creating images by an iterative process.

You don't need to learn the scripting languages to enjoy the examples provided with NextFractal. However, we recommend to play around with the scripts provided as examples, and try creating your own images. It is a lot of fun!

Don't worry, we have created a Wiki to help you, with examples of scripts for generating variants of the Mandelbrot Set using various techniques for colouring the image.
