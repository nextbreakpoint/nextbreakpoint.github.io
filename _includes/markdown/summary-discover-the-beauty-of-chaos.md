NextFractal is an application for creating fractals and other algorithmically generated images. Images are generated from instructions contained in a script. NextFractal provides tools for rendering fractals, creating time-based and event-based animations, organising images, and exporting images and animations.

NextFractal is currently able to interpret two scripting languages: Mandelbrot and CFDG. Mandelbrot is a domain specific language for creating images of the Mandelbrot set and its variants (the Julia and Fatou sets). CFDG is a context-free grammar for creating images by an iterative process.

You don't need to learn the scripting language to enjoy the examples provided with NextFractal, but if you do, then it is a lot of fun creating your own fractals. But don't worry, we have created a Wiki to help you, with a tutorial for the scripting language and examples of scripts. The only limit is your imagination.
